                <p>For over two decades, I worked as a director and supervisor on numerous animated TV productions. 

                <p>Then the pandemic hit, and I discovered the life balance and flexibility that remote work offered. 
                    
                <p>As a military spouse, the ability to work remotely also meant I could actually spend time with my husband, 
                and potentially follow him to stations abroad. When studios announced a return to in-house production less 
                than three years later, I knew it was time for a new path.
                    
                <p>I'm now a computer science major at Orange Coast College, transitioning to a new career 
                in middle age. While this shift has been daunting, it's made easier by the excitement of entering a field 
                where I can make a meaningful impact. I’m particularly interested in ecology and biology, and I’m 
                passionate about the possibility of supporting scientific research.
                    
                <p>What drives me is simple: we only have one planet, and it’s frustrating to see its resources and ecosystems 
                being misused. I’m determined to contribute to solutions that help protect and preserve it for future generations.
                    
                <p>I’ve been married for 12 years to my amazing partner Chuck, and we live in Seal Beach with our two very 
                spoiled cats. We love to travel and have explored Madagascar, England, Ireland, Japan, Costa Rica, and 
                France. I speak French and some Japanese. And though I've moved on from animation as a career, I still 
                love to draw and tell stories in my spare time.</p></Div>
