                        <p class="blog-body">In 2004, when I initially left college the first time, I didn't think I'd ever be back. 
                                I went into animation fueled by a drive to tell stories, but I found out in due time my stories were not 
                                going to be told. No matter, perhaps I could be the one to tell stories for others...but as years passed, 
                                I found the work I did fell less into the category of creative or story driven, and more a sort of filing 
                                and categorizing. I received an inordinate amount of praise for my organizational skills, which, while 
                                something I'm proud of, were not why I threw caution to the wind and moved to LA with only the promise 
                                of a 2-week gig. <br><br>

                                Certainly that meant stable work. If no one else could be arsed to track and label all the extras in a crowd 
                                scene, the job invariably fell to me since I did it without complaint. And for a long time, I labored under 
                                the assumption that this was some kind of dues I was paying, and someday, someone would notice my creative 
                                vision and drive and give me the opportunity to do what I'd set out to do, but for money. At the 20 year 
                                mark, I realized this was delusional, and I needed to jump ship. <br><br>
                                
                                So here I am, in middle age, a college student again. I am studying computer science - a surprisingly 
                                challenging and exciting field which uses an entirely different part of my brain. If the animation industry 
                                seems to content to wallow in an assortment of bland reboots of the same seven shows (soon enough to be 
                                assisted by an army of AI) then perhaps I should be the one programming the robots instead of letting them 
                                take my job? <br><br>
                                
                                I kid. (Mostly.)<br><br>
                                
                                I am, as an Elder Millenial (gross) a member of the last generation to grow up without, and then with, 
                                the spectre of social media. I have found it to be both beneficial and exhausting, but as time goes on, 
                                more the latter than the former. I've been told many times that when seeking a job, I need to "build 
                                my brand." The last I checked, I was a 42 year old human woman, not a corporation. I understand the 
                                need to put your best foot forward when representing yourself. I find the idea of human branding repugnant.
                                <br><Br>
                                
                                So I suppose this is my attempt at re-launching myself into the corporate world, but on my own terms: a 
                                long-form blog about my transition from creative to technical, from expert to novice, youth to middle 
                                age and beyond. I invite you to join me on this journey, as I, an Old Woman, yell at clouds. <br><Br>
