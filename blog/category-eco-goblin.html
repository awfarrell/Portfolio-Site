                                One of the (many) things I've been doing recently to combat my existential dread at, well, 
                                *gestures widely at the dumpster fire of worm-eaten billionare oligargchs my countryfolk 
                                decided were fit to rule us* is something I've colloquially been referring to as 
                                Eco Goblin-ing!<br><br>
                            
                                The idea is - if I can make it, thrift it, or find it in the garbage, I will. If I can 
                                make it out of garbage even better! This has led to a number of ongoing projects including:

                                    The stained glass hanging and woven tucan planter were also garbage finds, as was the 
                                    shelf. As was the raised bed. Technically so were the cats. You get the idea.</li>

                                I've been experimenting with cheesemaking and I want to try growing mushrooms again this summer - 
                                subsequently I've been on the lookout for a metal shelf and a mini-fridge on freecycle to use as 
                                a cheese cave.<br><br>

                                I've been gradually embracing Eco Goblin Life for the last 4 or 5 years, but began again in earnest last winter 
                                once I realized things were about to get shitty in new and exciting ways. One of the things I've been most 
                                fascinated with recently has been predicting the weather. I've even got Chuck on the train, although 
                                to be fair he has been wonderfully supportive and enthusiastic about all my weird schemes. <br><br>
                            </P>

                            <img src="../images/EcoGoblin/noaaathome.jpg" alt="The Weather Journal (tm)" class="blog-img-fullpost">

                                Our weather journal. This month I added space to add more specific data so I can more easily track things. 
                                I may even program something in the future to be able to enter data digitally instead of using the 
                                notebook. The cloud book (found secondhand on thriftbooks) has also been incredibly useful. <br><br>
                                
                                This way of living feels like finding treasures in a video game. There are so many resources. There is 
                                so much...<i>stuff</i> on this planet.  Everywhere. The vast majority of what I need can be sourced for free or 
                                secondhand, and there's something profoundly comforting about that for me. There's also the added bonus that 
                                capitalism doesn't work on me anymore, and neither does advertising. Despite the grave uncertainty that I'm 
                                facing as a human on this planet in The Year of Our Lord 2025, I am somewhat placated by the fact that I can 
                                rely on myself - to a point. Sure would be nice if we had, I dunno, a protective system in place. Crazy, I 
                                know. But until we're smart enough to build that for ourselves, I'll keep reading the clouds, I guess. <br><br>
